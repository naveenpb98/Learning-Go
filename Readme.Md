# Learning Go

**Learning Go** is designed to assist individuals in learning the Go programming language through a structured set of exercises. The exercise descriptions are provided in the `readme` files within each exercise folder. Below, you will find details about all the exercises included in this package.

## Exercise Descriptions

### Exercise 1: Printing type and value of a variable!
- **Description**: Get started with Go by creating a simple Go program to print the value and type of a variable.
- **Folder**: `Exercise-1`

### Exercise 2: Finding sum while reading numbers from standard input
- **Description**: Write a program that reads integers from standard input until it encounters an end-of-file (EOF) marker. As it reads each integer, the program should add the integer to a running total. Once the program encounters an EOF marker, it should print the final sum of all the integers it read.
- **Folder**: `Exercise-2`

### Exercise 3: Replace Strings
